# GameAchievementTrackerPythonII

This is a project that was created as a final project for Python II. It involves the use of Python Flask and SQLAlchemy to create a website that allows you to track video game achievements earned. There is a database that is used to store and query all of the user data. There is a login and signup page that have you create a user account for the webpage. Once in the page you have the option to add a new game, add achievements, add new game platforms, search the achievements you have added, and search the games you have added. If any errors occur, there is a message that is flashed to alert the user to the error they have made. To run this project a table in the main.py must be used along with the password to access the SQL table. You must also use PIP install the imports located on the main.py and tables.py.
